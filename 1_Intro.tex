\section{Overview}

In this report, I aim to provide a clear view of my objectives for this PhD and the progress 
I have made towards achieving them.

This report is divided into three principal sections: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Overview}: This section provides a brief introduction to my current progress in both research 
    and the PhD Study Programme, along with the overarching aims of the PhD.
    \item \textbf{Research}: Discusses both current and projected research activities as part of this PhD programme.
    \item \textbf{PhD Study Programme}: Details both progress to date and future objectives aligned with the study 
    requirements of the programme.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Aim}

This PhD aims to enhance the understanding and transparency of machine learning predictions through the 
introduction of novel methods and evaluations of explainable AI (XAI). 
With a technical focus, I aim to concurrently develop usable, open-source tools that complement my research.

\subsection*{Current projects}
The contributions are categorised as follows: Papers that have been submitted are highlighted 
in \textbf{bold}, and those that are ongoing are in \textit{italics}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Novel Explanation Methods}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{XAIStories}: Natural language narratives formed from SHAP and counterfactual explanations.
        \item \textbf{CoF Tables}: A method to aggregate instance-level explanations to identify shortcuts in 
        image classification models.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Evaluation of XAI Methods}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{PCherry}: Evaluates the probablilty that a given set of counterfactuals includes 
        cherry-picked explanations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{AXA Collaboration}: Improving mail switching LLM through the analysis of counterfactual explanations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Progress towards Study Program}
The program requires the accumulation of 30 credits. Below is the summary of credits earned to date:
