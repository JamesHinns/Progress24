\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Courses}

The study programme requires at least 12 credits from courses approved by the university.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DLCV Summer School}:
     Deep Learning and Computer Vision summer school, confirmed with department
    to count as 6 credits for competency A.
    \item \textit{Optimisation with Meta Heuristics}:
    I still need to complete the research portion of the course.
    For this I plan to optimise the combination of segment within the instance level CaFe explanations which form 
    CoF tables.
    This functionality is required for a number of the planned papers, such as CoF Tables 2.0 and 
    Fairness in Image Classification. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Other Non-Research Credit Contributions}

\textbf{Masters Supervisions}
    \begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Student Name} & \textbf{Date of Completion} \\ \hline
        Camille Dams & Jan 2023 \\ \hline
        Margot Willemse & Jan 2024 \\ \hline
        Tibo Vanleke & Expected May 2024\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Doctoral Day} \\
The study programme requires that I participate in the Doctoral Day, as a discussant and speaker, as well as
attending twice. I have attended before, and in the next Doctoral Day I plan to be both a discussant and a speaker,
fufilling the requirements for competency F, and adding 2 credits to my total.

\section{Other}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cambridge Summer School on Probabilistic Machine Learning} I was selected to particpate in the
    cambridge summer school on Probabilistic machine learning.
    \item \textbf{Reviewer for KDD} I reviewed 6 papers for SIGKDD 2024.
    \item \textit{Research Stays} I hope that after my next round of papers, to be in a position to apply for some
    research stays at other institutions, with the aim to foster further collaboration and build my network.
